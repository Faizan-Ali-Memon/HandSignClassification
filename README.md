# Hand Sign Language Digit Classification (0â€“5) 

This project focuses on building a deep learning model to classify hand sign language digits (from 0 to 5). It demonstrates the use of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **ResNet50 (transfer learning)** for image classification tasks.

## ðŸ“¥ Dataset

The dataset is publicly available on **Kaggle**:
[Hand Sign Language Digit Dataset (0â€“5)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivam1711/hand-sign-language-digit-dataset-for-0-5)

---

## ðŸ–¥ Usage

1. Open the Streamlit app.
2. Upload an image of a hand sign (from `testing-images/` or any new image).
3. The app preprocesses the image and passes it to the trained ResNet50 model.
4. The predicted class label and confidence scores are displayed.
5. Predicted results are saved in the `testing-images-results/` folder.
